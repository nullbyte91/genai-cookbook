## 📘 Introduction
This repository is a research-driven framework for adopting and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively and responsibly.

Instead of jumping directly into fine-tuning, this project explores a <b>layered approach to LLM system design</b>, combining industry best practices, cost-effective techniques, and deep evaluations. It aims to help you decide <b>when to use prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or full/parameter-efficient fine-tuning</b>, based on your task, domain, and constraints.

The goal is to build a modular, extensible pipeline that supports experimentation, benchmarking, and eventual deployment of high-performing, domain-specific LLMs — while maintaining reproducibility, traceability, and practical relevance.
